Project I created as part of the interview process for Anyfin.
Team was happy enough with it, got me past the interview stage.
No offer after 7 stages though.

For the project spec, see: Software Engineer - Python Assessment.pdf
For the report and how to run, see: report.docx

You probably want to use the extra branch :)
